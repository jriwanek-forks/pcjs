IBM PC (Model 5150) BIOS ROMs include:

  - [Model 5150: Apr 24, 1981](bios/1981-04-24/PCBIOS-REV1.json) (included with [IBM BASIC C1.00](basic/BASIC100.json))
  - [Model 5150: Oct 19, 1981](bios/1981-10-19/PCBIOS-REV2.json) (included with [IBM BASIC C1.00](basic/BASIC100.json))
  - [Model 5150: Oct 27, 1982](bios/1982-10-27/PCBIOS-REV3.json) (included with [IBM BASIC C1.00](basic/BASIC100.json) *or* [IBM BASIC C1.10](../../5160/rom/basic/BASIC110.json))

In general, IBM BASIC ROM images are 32Kb and IBM BIOS ROM images are 8Kb, and together they provide 40Kb of contiguous
read-only memory, with the BASIC ROM spanning physical addresses 0xF6000-0xFDFFF and the BIOS ROM spanning addresses
0xFE000-0xFFFFF.

As hinted above, some newer Model 5150 machines with the **Oct 27, 1982** BIOS included IBM BASIC C1.10.  And
some even *newer* 5150 machines had a BIOS with a "1982" copyright year instead of "1981", which also changed the checksum
byte from 0x78 to 0x77.  However, the project includes only the original "1981" version, since the difference is trivial.
