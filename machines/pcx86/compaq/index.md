PCjs currently supports the following COMPAQ machines:

  - [COMPAQ Portable](portable/vdu/)

Here is a roughly chronological list of COMPAQ machines from the 1980s, which PCjs hopes to eventually support:

  - [COMPAQ Portable](#compaq-portable)
  - [COMPAQ Plus](#compaq-plus)
  - [COMPAQ DeskPro](#compaq-deskpro)
  - [COMPAQ DeskPro 286](#compaq-deskpro-286)
  - [COMPAQ Portable 286](#compaq-portable-286)
  - [COMPAQ Portable II](#compaq-portable-ii)
  - [COMPAQ DeskPro 386](#compaq-deskpro-386)
  - [COMPAQ Portable III](#compaq-portable-iii)
  - COMPAQ DeskPro 386/20
  - [COMPAQ Portable 386](#compaq-portable-386)
  - COMPAQ DeskPro 386/25
  - COMPAQ DeskPro 386s
  - [COMPAQ DeskPro 386/20e](#compaq-38620e)
  - [COMPAQ SLT Series](#compaq-slt-series) (SLT/286)
  - COMPAQ DeskPro 386/33
  - [COMPAQ LTE Series](#compaq-lte-series) (LTE and LTE/286)

### Regarding The COMPAQ Name

As best I can tell, COMPAQ preferred to print its company name in all-caps, so that's my practice as well.

However, it seems that sometime between the release of [COMPAQ MS-DOS 3.10](/software/pcx86/sys/dos/compaq/3.10/) and
[COMPAQ MS-DOS 3.31](/software/pcx86/sys/dos/compaq/3.31/), there may have been a shift in policy.  Both products still
called themselves `The COMPAQ Personal Computer MS-DOS`, but in 3.31, the copyright string changed to
`Compaq Computer Corp.`

Their all-caps practice also extended to product names (e.g., `COMPAQ DESKPRO`), at least in their marketing literature.
Contemporary news stories, however, tended to lower-case the product name (eg, `COMPAQ Deskpro`).  I've decided to
split the difference and use mixed-case where it seems appropriate (e.g., `COMPAQ DeskPro`).

The rest of this page provides brief highlights (and PCjs resources where available) for each of the machines listed above.

about $3,000 worth of extra RAM memory that cannot be utilized by any application software programs now on the market.
(It can be used to simulate a disk drive to speed up programs, however.)

at $6,254, compared to IBM's similarly equipped enhanced PC AT that offers only a 20-megabyte hard disk. The Portable
