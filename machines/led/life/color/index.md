[John Conway's](http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/John_Horton_Conway)
"[Game of Life](http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)", using a grid of simulated multi-colored LEDs.

Any LED color can be specified in the URL, such as [Red](?color=red&pattern=gliderGun#lifeDemo) or 
[Blue](?color=blue&pattern=gliderGun#lifeDemo).
